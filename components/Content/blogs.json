Small habits make a big difference. Here’s how to keep your carpets fresh between deep cleans.</p>\n\n<h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>1. Vacuum Frequently</strong></h2>\n<p class='mb-4'>Regular vacuuming prevents dirt and allergens from embedding into carpet fibers. Experts recommend vacuuming at least once a week—but busy households, especially with kids or pets, may benefit from twice-weekly vacuum sessions :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. Use overlapping strokes and tackle high-traffic zones slowly to lift ground-in debris :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.</p>\n\n<h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>2. Tackle Spills Immediately</strong></h2>\n<p class='mb-4'>Got a spill? Act fast. Blot—don’t rub—with a clean, white cloth to soak up liquid. Treat the spot quickly using a mild carpet cleaner or a homemade blend of vinegar and water :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. Rinse lightly, blot again, and let it dry fully to avoid stains or matting.</p>\n\n<h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>3. Use Doormats & Remove Shoes</strong></h2>\n<p class='mb-4'>Stop dirt before it reaches your carpet. Place mats at entryways and encourage shoe-free zones indoors. Doing this alone can significantly reduce soil tracked in—especially during outdoor projects or after pet walks :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.</p>\n\n<h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>4. Spot Clean with Natural Boosts</strong></h2>\n<p class='mb-4'>For stubborn odors or minor stains, sprinkle baking soda over the area, let it sit for a few hours, then vacuum :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}. It freshens and absorbs smells without needing harsh chemicals.</p>\n\n<h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>5. Rotate Furniture & Add Rugs</strong></h2>\n<p class='mb-4'>Even wear keeps carpet looking better longer. Move furniture occasionally, use area rugs in busy zones, and place protective pads under heavy items :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.</p>\n\n<h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>6. Maintain Air Quality</strong></h2>\n<p class='mb-4'>Dust and allergens settle into carpet fibers over time. Change HVAC filters regularly and vacuum using HEPA-equipped models to minimize airborne particles :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.</p>\n\n<h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>7. Know When to Deep Clean</strong></h2>\n<p class='mb-4'>Even with great upkeep, carpets require real cleaning. Most pros recommend a hot-water extraction (aka steam clean) every 12–18 months :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}. Homes with allergens, pets, or heavy use may benefit from annual or twice-yearly cleanings.</p>\n\n<h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>8. Avoid Over-Wetting</strong></h2>\n<p class='mb-4'>More water doesn’t mean better results—it just causes longer drying times and possible mold issues :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}. Use machines or cleaners that extract moisture, then dry the area thoroughly.</p>\n\n<h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>9. Hire Certified Professionals</strong></h2>\n<p class='mb-4'>When it’s time for a deep clean, look for IICRC-certified carpet cleaners. They use approved solutions and methods that keep your carpet warranty intact and your home healthy :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.</p>\n\n<h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>10. Keep Going—It Adds Up</strong></h2>\n<p class='mb-4'>Good carpet care isn’t a one-time fix. Weekly vacuuming, quick spill response, and occasional deep cleans can extend your carpet's life from 5 to 15 years :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}. That’s more comfort, fewer replacements, and better indoor air quality over time.</p>\n\n<p class='mb-4'>Your carpet works hard for you. With a few simple habits and a trusted pro on call, you can keep it looking fresh and feel great underfoot. Need a deep clean? We can help—just reach out!</p>"
